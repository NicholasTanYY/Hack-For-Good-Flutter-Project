# Hack For Good Flutter Project

## Inspiration

We were inspired by existing interactive focum-based websites such as Reddit and LinkedIN.

## What it does

Anyone with creative ideas can conveniently share and seek others with similar innovations. The app is accessible by all, be it organisations, workers or even the general public.

## How we built it

Since we only had 2 members and both relatively unfamiliar with the Flutter framework, we decided to work together to build each component.

## Challenges we ran into

There was a severe shortage of time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite being newbies at Flutter, we managed to create something workable over a very short period of time.

## What we learned

We learnt that it is important to have a concrete plan before proceeding with the code.
